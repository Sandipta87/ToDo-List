# ToDo-List
This is project created using TypeScript, Jquary and Html5 local storage as database.

Once downloaded, one can use this code to create to-do lists or simple lists.

For the first time user will only see one button named '+ Add New'. This will help user to create lists with no items. 
Once a new list is created, there will be a button on the top of the list named '+ Add Item'. This will help user create items inside the list one as a time.

There are 'x' icons next to each item and list title. This will help the user delete the item from the list or the full list(if user click on the 'x' next to list title).
